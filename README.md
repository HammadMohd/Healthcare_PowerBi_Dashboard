# Healthcare_PowerBi_Dashboard

This project provides a comprehensive Healthcare Dashboard built in Power BI to help Hospital Management Teams track and analyze critical hospital metrics. The dashboard integrates data visualizations and KPIs to monitor patient visits, resource availability, revenue, appointment waiting times, and feedback on medical services, supporting data-driven decision-making.

# Project Objectives

Data Visualization: Develop interactive visuals to display hospital performance metrics effectively.

Data Transformation: Use Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

Data Modeling: Create a robust data model with relationships between fact and dimension tables.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Design KPIs to track key metrics like patient count, bed occupancy, and average wait time.

Interactive Visuals: Implement bar charts, line charts, maps, and tables for comprehensive data analysis.

Custom Visuals: Utilize rotating cards, scrollers, and other custom visuals for a better user experience.

Drill-Down Capabilities: Add drill-down and drill-through functionalities for deeper insights.

Filtering and Slicing: Use slicers and filters to enable data segmentation by department, age group, and more.

Navigation: Incorporate buttons and navigation for a seamless report browsing experience.

# Project Overview

Data Source: Utilizes MS Excel for data inputs.

Data Transformations: Includes merging, trimming, and data type changes in Power Query Editor.

Data Model: Establishes relationships between tables like bed details, staff details, department, and other datasets.

Visualizations: Includes KPIs, bar charts, line charts, maps, tables, and custom visuals to provide a complete view of hospital metrics.

Functionality: Implements drill-down and drill-through features for detailed patient information, as well as filters, slicers, and navigational buttons.

# Benefits

Centralized Information: Provides a unified view of hospital operations for better monitoring and management.

Data-Driven Decisions: Assists management in making informed decisions about resource allocation, patient care, and operational efficiency.
